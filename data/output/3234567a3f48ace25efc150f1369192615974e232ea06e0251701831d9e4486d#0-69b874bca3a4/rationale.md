# Rationale: 3234567a3f48ace25efc150f1369192615974e232ea06e0251701831d9e4486d#0
Recommendation: **ABSTAIN**
Score: `0.0` (raw `0.0` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.0`) | Confidence: `0.1` | Readiness: `0`


## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-template)
BEACN's autonomous DRep recorded ABSTAIN on "Scalus 2026: Maintenance, Dijkstra Readiness, Interoperability & Application Runtime" (TreasuryWithdrawals). This is a conservative, evidence-based hold rather than opposition. A key material claim lacks independent support: "Scalus components are reused in Cardano Client Lib, YaciDevKit, MeshJS SDK, Evolution SDK, and Lucid Evolution.". Open questions before a directional vote: treasury_amount_lovelace is missing for a treasury withdrawal. Reason code: MISSING_BASELINE_EVIDENCE. (Plain-language summary generated deterministically; a model-written explanation appears here when the reasoning layer is enabled.)

## Review Tree
- overall_status: `blocked`

### Intake
- status: `blocked`
- finding: Action type: TreasuryWithdrawals
- finding: Status: active
- finding: Proposed epoch: 640
- finding: Expires after epoch: 647
- finding: Treasury request: not specified
- finding: Anchor pinned locally: yes
- missing: treasury_amount_lovelace is missing for a treasury withdrawal
- conclusion: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `thin`
- finding: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: yes
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: manifest
- finding: Deep research dossier: complete
- finding: Requested: Continuation funding for Scalus 2026 covering maintenance, Dijkstra hard-fork readiness, interoperability across JVM and JS/TS ecosystems, and a scoped application runtime.
- finding: Recipient: Lantr Engineering
- finding: Stated amount: 2464844
- finding: Deliverables: Ongoing maintenance including bug fixes, dependency upkeep, security patches, and releases, Dijkstra developer preview with initial Plutus V4 support in the compiler and standard library, Dijkstra ledger rules and transaction-builder updates including new builtins, cost models, nested transactions, accounts, and guard scripts, Improved JS/TS interfaces and documentation for components embedded in MeshJS, Evolution SDK, and Lucid Evolution, Java/Kotlin integration including Spring Boot and Ktor examples and cleaner integration with Cardano Client Lib and Yaci, Foundational runtime components, reactive workers, chain follower, and task scheduler, Reference applications, integration tests, and early-user feedback for the scoped runtime
- finding: Deadline/expiry: March 2027
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): Scalus is an open-source Cardano development platform built by Lantr Engineering over three years of continuous delivery.
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal requests ₳2,464,844 for 9 months at a $0.16/ADA reference rate with no contingency.
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal is reduced from a previous ₳8.503M 12-month proposal to ₳2.464844M over 9 months, with FTE reduced from 8.25 to 2.25 and contingency reduced from 10% to 0%.
- finding: Claim (adoption, proposer_asserted, high materiality): Scalus components are reused in Cardano Client Lib, YaciDevKit, MeshJS SDK, Evolution SDK, and Lucid Evolution.
- finding: Claim (adoption, proposer_asserted, high materiality): The proposer says protocols and applications including Gummiworm L2, Bifrost, SugarRush, Vela, and DID/DIDComm are built on Scalus.
- finding: Claim (adoption, independently_verifiable, medium materiality): The document states Scalus has 4,642 commits across 32 releases, 12 contributors, and Scalus.js reaches more than 20,000 downloads per month.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Scalus components are reused in Cardano Client Lib, YaciDevKit, MeshJS SDK, Evolution SDK, and Lucid Evolution.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposer says protocols and applications including Gummiworm L2, Bifrost, SugarRush, Vela, and DID/DIDComm are built on Scalus.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Delivery is described as milestone-based through audited SundaeSwap treasury contracts with an independent oversight board and third-party assurance.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Lantr Engineering says every prior Scalus milestone was delivered on time and commits to public reporting, open community sessions, and on-time milestone delivery for treasury-funded work.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 0
- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: confirmed
- finding: Clawback/refund path: confirmed
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: confirmed
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: unknown
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.82
- missing: sustainability path
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: medium
- finding: Governance risk: medium
- finding: Technical risk: medium
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: medium
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: confirmed
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "Scalus is an open-source Cardano development platform built by Lantr Engineering over three years of continuous delivery." though 1 review blocker(s) remain open.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "Scalus components are reused in Cardano Client Lib, YaciDevKit, MeshJS SDK, Evolution SDK, and Lucid Evolution." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: evidence is too thin for a directional vote while 1 blocker(s) remain open.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `blocked`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- missing: treasury_amount_lovelace is missing for a treasury withdrawal
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
